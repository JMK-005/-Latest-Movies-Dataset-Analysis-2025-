## 📁 Dataset Information
- **Filename:** Latest 2025 Movies Datasets.csv
- **Main Columns Used:**  
  `title`, `release_date`, `original_language`, `popularity`, `vote_average`, `vote_count`

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Imported dataset using Pandas  
2. Cleaned missing values and converted release date to datetime format  
3. Extracted `year` and `month` from release dates  
4. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Created visualizations:
   - Popularity distribution
   - Ratings distribution
   - Movies by language
   - Popularity by release month
   - Popularity vs rating relationship
6. Answered research question based on findings

---

## 📊 Key Insights (Final Outcome)
- Most movies have average ratings between **5 and 7**
- **Popularity is highest** for movies released in **July, September, and October**
- **English** is the most common language among released movies
- There is a **weak correlation** between popularity and ratings, meaning:
  - High ratings do not guarantee high popularity
  - Popularity is strongly affected by marketing, release timing, and audience hype

### 🎯 Final Conclusion
> Popularity is influenced more by release timing and language than ratings, and not all highly rated movies become popular.
